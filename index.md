# I create for the web

My projects involve taking complex business processes and turning them into easy-to-use applications. I am currently an innovation specialist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

I hold a BS in Telecommunications from The [University of Kentucky](http://www.uky.edu/) and live in [Louisville, KY](https://louisvilleky.gov/).
