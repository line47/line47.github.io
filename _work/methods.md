The 18F Method Cards are a collection of tools that describe how 18F teams put human-centered design into practice. Simplified instructions help other organizations and federal offices adopt human-centered design into their own projects. The cards are focused on design in the context of digital services, but can be adapted to non-technical design projects as well.
