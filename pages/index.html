        I've dedicated my career since 2004 to enhancing online experiences for US citizens. My focuses include design systems,
        front-end user experience, web standards, and accessibility. I enjoy working transparently, conducting user
        research, and making complex processes easier. 
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I work for <a href="https://adhocteam.us/">Ad Hoc</a> as a Manager of Design.</p>
    <p>
        I've worked with various federal, state, and local governments. My work includes <a href="https:cms.gov">Centers
            for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation
            (NSF)</a>, the <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/">Thrift Savings Program (TSP)</a>, <a href="https://login.gov/">Login.gov</a>, <a href="https://cloud.gov">Cloud.gov</a> and <a
            href="https://kentucky.gov">Kentucky.gov</a>.
        I am alum of both <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a> and <a href="https://www.egov.com/">NIC Inc.</a> and
        bring a passion for web standards, human centered design, and research.

    <p>
        I hold a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunications from The
        <a href="https://www.uky.edu/">University of Kentucky</a> and live in
        Asheville, NC. When I'm not working I like to compose and write music, spend time outdoors with my family,
        work in my garden, build things with my hands or enjoy a nice beer or bourbon.
