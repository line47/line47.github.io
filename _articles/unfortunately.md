Never in my 20+ year career in government technology have I gotten this many rejection letters. It’s hard not to take it personally, and even harder to keep [imposter syndrome](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/feeling-like-fraud-imposter-syndrome-common-among-high) from creeping in.

I’m a design generalist who’s done a bit of everything. SEO and content, information architecture, design tokens/variables, leading research sessions, building surveys. I’ve had the chance to grow across teams and problem spaces. I’ve coached and mentored designers, researchers, and product folks, and I’ve helped teams that were struggling to collaborate rally around processes that actually work. Over the last five years I’ve focused on user experience and design leadership, design systems, and product design.

I've also had the privilege to work impactful projects: 

* [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services design system](https://design.cms.gov/)
* [18F methods](https://guides.18f.org/methods/)
* Veterans Health Administration Enrollment System

Right now, the government tech climate isn’t great. Layoffs and reductions are hitting not just agencies and vendors, but big tech broadly. Add the nonstop AI drumbeat and, yeah, I’m concerned about future employment. I’m finding myself looking for off-ramps in a space that used to feel secure and established.

I’ve tried different styles and lengths of résumés and cover letters. I’ve tailored them for UX lead, design system, and senior product design roles I’m genuinely qualified for. What’s come back is a flood of no’s that doesn’t match the experience and value I know I can bring.

As a bit of comic relief, I’m reminding myself: ***“I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.”*** I don’t always feel it when the twelfth “unfortunately” hits my inbox, but I believe it.

## A few of the recent replies

I’ve sent well over a hundred applications. Here’s the general flavor of what’s been coming back. It’s the reality a lot of folks are living through right now.

Gov tech and tech at large are rough right now. 
I’m a design generalist with 20+ years of impact, and lately I’m hitting a wall of “unfortunately” emails. I wrote about the reality, the work I’ve done, and where I can help.
