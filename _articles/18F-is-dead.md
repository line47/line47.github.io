When I joined 18F, I knew I was stepping into something special. It wasn’t just another government agency—it was a team of mission-driven technologists, designers, and strategists dedicated to improving public services. 18F introduced modern digital practices into an outdated system, making government services easier, faster and more accessible. Whether designing inclusive websites, modernizing authentication or enhancing cloud infrastructure, the goal remained the same: serving people better. And now, it’s gone.

The decision to dismantle 18F wasn’t about inefficiency or cost—it was politics. The Trump administration often rolled back Obama-era programs regardless of their success. 18F, recognized for its innovation in government technology, became an easy target. Instead of refining its structure, leadership chose to eliminate it, erasing years of progress.

This is poor leadership. 18F could have been adapted, improved or scaled more effectively. Instead, it was scrapped entirely, leaving agencies with fewer options, stalling advancements in government technology and leaving agencies with in progress work high and dry.

The need for better digital services remains. Government systems are still outdated, agencies still struggle with inefficiencies and citizens still deserve modern, accessible services. 

## 18F was built to improve and modernize government

In 2014, a group of presidential innovation fellows founded 18F to bring change to government tech because it was clear that traditional IT procurement—bloated contracts, slow-moving development cycles, and user-hostile design—wasn’t working. 18F did things a bit differently:

* **Worked in the open** with agile, user-centered design instead of rigid, waterfall-style development.

* **Prioritized user needs** by conducting research, testing, and iterating to ensure government services were designed for the people who actually use them.

* **Created reusable solutions** that could scale across agencies instead of reinventing the wheel with every new project.

* **Operated as a cost-recoverable team** that did not rely on appropriated funds from Congress, and instead charged agencies for services.

## My projects at 18F

I had the privilege of working on projects that fundamentally changed how government digital services function. These weren’t just theoretical improvements—they directly benefited federal employees and everyday people who rely on government services. These projects reduced inefficiencies and made government services actually work for the people they were meant to serve.

* **[Login.gov](https://login.gov)** – A secure, user-friendly authentication system that replaced inefficient, agency-specific logins, making access to federal services easier and safer.

* **[Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov)** – A modern cloud hosting platform that improved security and streamlined infrastructure for federal agencies.

* **[America's Seed Fund](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/)** – A complete redesign of the National Science Foundation’s Seed Fund website, making it easier for startups and researchers to apply for federal funding.

* **[18F Methods](https://18f.org/guides/methods/)** – An open-source collection of UX and human-centered design methods tailored for government agencies, helping teams build better digital services.

* **[U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** – A design system that standardized accessibility-compliant, user-friendly components across federal websites, making government services easier to navigate for millions of Americans.

* **[Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Modernization](https://www.tsp.gov/)** – A complete UX overhaul of the federal retirement savings platform, improving usability for government employees and retirees.

## Projects stalled

The abrupt termination of 18F has disrupted numerous critical projects aimed at modernizing and improving government digital services. Agencies that depended on 18F’s expertise are now facing major setbacks—some projects have stalled completely, while others are scrambling for alternative solutions with limited resources. Without 18F, agencies are losing a trusted partner that understood how to build efficient, user-centered government technology in a way that traditional vendors simply do not.

### Notable project affected

* **[Weather.gov Modernization](https://www.weather.gov/)** - 18F was collaborating with the National Weather Service to overhaul its outdated technology infrastructure. The project aimed to provide a more stable public API, implement a modern content management system, and redesign the website for easier public access to weather information. With 18F’s dissolution, this initiative has been left incomplete, leaving the National Weather Service with less reliable and more time-consuming tools.

* **[Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)](https://www.fvap.gov/)** - To ensure that military service members and Americans overseas could vote efficiently, 18F was assisting FVAP in enhancing their email-to-fax service, which was overwhelmed during presidential elections. The project’s sudden halt means that FVAP may continue to face challenges in processing high volumes of ballot submissions securely and efficiently.

* **[IRS Direct File Service](https://directfile.irs.gov/)** - In collaboration with the IRS, 18F played a pivotal role in developing the Direct File program, a free service allowing eligible taxpayers to file taxes directly with the IRS. Although the service remains active, the loss of 18F’s support jeopardizes future expansions and improvements, potentially hindering efforts to provide a comprehensive, free tax filing option for all Americans. This is especially impactful for low-income individuals who rely on free tax-filing solutions.

* **In Care Case Management System for Unaccompanied Children** - 18F was working with the Office of Refugee Resettlement to replace an outdated case management system used for unaccompanied children entering the U.S. The legacy system’s deficiencies posed safety risks, and 18F’s project aimed to build a modern, user-centered solution. The project’s abrupt cessation leaves vulnerable children at continued risk due to technological shortcomings.

The dismantling of 18F not only stalls these significant projects but also undermines the momentum toward a more efficient, user-friendly digital government. The absence of 18F’s innovative approaches and dedicated teams poses a substantial setback to the progress of public service technology.

## What now?

The end of 18F leaves a significant gap in the effort to modernize government technology. Agencies that once had a trusted, agile partner for improving digital services are now left with fewer options—forced to rely on outdated contracting models or internal teams that may lack the same level of expertise. Some of the most impactful work in government digital transformation has been disrupted, and without a team like 18F, the pace of innovation will slow.

However, all is not lost. The alumni of 18F are already spreading their expertise across the civic tech ecosystem, bringing their skills to state and local governments, non-profits, and private firms committed to improving public services. Others might bring their experience back into federal agencies, working from the inside to push for better digital government.

The same reasons 18F existed in the first place—outdated technology, expensive IT contracts, and poor user experiences—are still problems today. Killing 18F doesn’t solve those issues; it just makes them harder to fix.
