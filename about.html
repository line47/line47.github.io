<p>
I'm Scott, thanks for stopping by. I design, plan and implement websites and applications in addition to creating standards and best practices. I currently work as an innovation specialist at 18F. I've worked with partners ranging from government agencies to local cities and counties to private companies and enthusiastic startups. I enjoy transforming projects with simple design, thoughtfulness, and organization.

When I'm not coding I like to compose and write music, spend time with my family, work in my garden, play soccer or enjoy a nice beer or bourbon.
